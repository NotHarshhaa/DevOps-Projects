<h1>JPetStore Demo</h1>

<p>
  The JPetStore Demo is an online pet store. Like most e-stores, you can browse
  and search the product catalog, choose items to add to a shopping cart, amend
  the shopping cart, and order the items in the shopping cart. You can perform
  many of these actions without registering with or logging into the
  application. However, before you can order items you must log in (sign in) to
  the application. In order to sign in, you must have an account with the
  application, which is created when you register (sign up) with the
  application.

<h2><a id="Catalog" name="Catalog"></a>Working with the Product Catalog</h2>

<p>This section describes how to browse and search the product catalog.</p>

<h4><a id="CatalogBrowsing" name="CatalogBrowsing"></a>Browsing the Catalog</h4>

<p>
  The pet store catalog is organized hierarchically as follows: categories,
  products, items.
</p>

<p>
  You list the pets in a category by clicking on the category name in the
  left column of the main page, or by clicking on the picture representing the
  category.
</p>

<p>
  Once you select a category, the pet store will display a list of products
  within a category. Selecting a product displays a list of items and their
  prices. Selecting a product item displays a text and visual description of
  the item and the number of that item in stock.
</p>

<h4><a id="CatalogSearching" name="CatalogSearching"></a>Searching the Catalog</h4>

<p>
  You search for products by typing the product name in search field in the
  middle of the banner.
</p>

<h2><a id="ShoppingCart" name="ShoppingCart"></a>Working with the Shopping Cart</h2>

<h4><a id="ShoppingCartAdd" name="ShoppingCartAdd"></a>Adding and Removing Items</h4>

  the right of an item. This action also displays your shopping cart.
</p>

  You can remove the item by clicking the Remove button to the left of the
  item.
</p>

<p>
  To continue shopping, you select a product category from the list under
  the banner.

<h4><a id="ShoppingCartUpdate" name="ShoppingCartUpdate"></a>Updating the Quantity of an Item</h4>

<p>
  You adjust the quantity of an item by typing the quantity in the item's
  Quantity field in the shopping cart and clicking the Update button.
</p>

<p>
  If the quantity of items requested is greater than that in stock, the In
  Stock field in the shopping cart will show that the item is backordered.
</p>

<h4><a id="Ordering" name="Ordering"></a>Ordering Items</h4>

  You order the items in the shopping cart by selecting the Proceed to Checkout
  button. The pet store will display a read-only list of the shopping cart
  contents. To proceed with the checkout, click the Continue button.
</p>

<p>
  If you have not signed in, the application will display the signin page,
  where you will need to provide your account name and password. Otherwise, the
  application will display a page requesting payment and shipping information.
  When you have filled in the required information, you click the Submit
  button, and the application will display a read-only page containing your
  billing and shipping address. If you need to change any information,
  click your browser's Back button and enter the correct information. To
  complete the order, you click the Continue button.
</p>

<h2><a id="OrderReview" name="OrderReview"></a>Reviewing An Order</h2>
